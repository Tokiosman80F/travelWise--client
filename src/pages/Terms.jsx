        Guru, the most laid-back and unconventional practice platform on the
        internet. By using this website, you agree to these terms and
        conditions,
      </p>
      which are here purely for fun: Practice Rules:
      <li>Rule #1: You must practice,but only if you feel like it.</li>
      <li>Rule #2: If youre having a bad day, blameit on lag.</li>

      <h3>Account and Password:</h3>
      <p>
        We dont actually care about your password, but please dont use
        "password123." Practice Material: Our practice material may be as real
        as a unicorns mane or as mythical as a mermaids singing, but whos
        keeping score? User Conduct: You are encouraged to laugh at mistakes,
        celebrate your wins, and ignore that perfectionist voice in your head.
        Privacy Policy: We promise not to sell your data, because we dont even
        know where we put it.
      </p>
      <h3>Cookies:</h3>
      <p>
        We have cookies, but theyre the kind you cant eat. Theyre just bits of
        data, so dont try to dunk them in milk. Termination: We cant imagine
        why, but if we ever decide to part ways, well do it as gracefully as a
        cat falling off a windowsill.
      </p>

        chicken convention. Have fun practicing
